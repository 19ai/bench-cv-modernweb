- how thread notify each other ?
  - currently this is message ?
  - could it be better with atomics ?
- Current communication
  - main-thread - asking workers to process part of the image
  - worker - telling main-thread the process is completed
- issue with the setup
  - i copy the whole thing SO SO much
- can i copy the frame less often
